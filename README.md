# The Monoidal Monastery of Mathematics

This is a Clojure repo for exploring mathematics with the intention of doing so
in [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com).

The code will be written here first, in Emacs, using Cider, and then ported to
the ClojureScript environment embedded in Roam.

## wtf is a monoid

A **monoid** a non-empty set $M$ together with a binary associative operation $* : M \times M \to M$,
and there is on special element $e \in M$ that doesn't change under the operation, so for every $a \in M$, it's the case that $e * a = e * a = a$.
